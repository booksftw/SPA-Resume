      <h1 class="nick-occupation-header">Full-Stack Developer</h1>
      <p class="nick-occupation-description">
        My first paid exposure to development was working under a software engineer for Cisco,
        the experience was invaluable.<br><br>

        I knew my interest in the field was real when I developed <br>
        a storyboard app to propose to my wife, and was successful. <br><br>
        
        For 3 years my work was half graphic design and web development, <br>
        You can find my work in Canadian Jewellers and Business Jewellers magazines, Las Vegas jewelry tradeshow, Hong Kong jewelry tradeshow, <a href="#professional"> for websites please see below.</a> <br><br>

        At this point in my developer journey I am enjoying my exposure <br>
        to Javascript and frameworks like Angular and React as a full stack tool.<br> 
        I’m enthralled with it’s ability to have control over and influence the user experience.<br> 
        Looking for opportunities to grow in these modern stacks and strengthen my backend abilities.
