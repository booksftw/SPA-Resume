      <h1 class="nick-occupation-header">Full-Stack Developer</h1>
      <p class="nick-occupation-description">
        My first paid exposure to development was through opportunities to create
        Wordpress sites and plug-ins for a previous employer. 
        I worked under a software engineer for Cisco, the experience was invaluable.<br><br>
        
        I knew my interest in the field was real when I developed <br>
        a storyboard app to propose to my wife, and was successful. <br><br>
        
        My work was half graphic design and web development, <br>
        I published lots of media for tradeshows, websites, everything the company needed, <br> some of my highlights are full page ads in Canadian Jewellers and Business Jewellers magazines. <br><br>

        Wanting to transition into web development full-time, <br>
        I enrolled in Lighthouse Lab’s bootcamp and am now pursuing opportunities for Full Stack Web Development.<br><br>

        At this point in my developer journey I am enjoying my exposure <br>
        to Javascript and frameworks like Angular and React as a full stack tool.<br> 
        I’m enthralled with it’s ability to have control over and influence the user experience.<br> 
        Looking for opportunities to grow in these modern stacks and strengthen my backend abilities.
